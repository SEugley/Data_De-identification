# 🕵🏻‍♂️ Data De-identification

## Summary
A comprehensive risk assessment of a telecom customer survey dataset to evaluate the potential for customer re-identification was performed. Statistical methods and probabilistic algorithms were applied across four scenarios: intentional attack, unintentional recognition, data breaches, and public disclosure. Equivalence classes for quasi-identifiers, ensuring adequate group sizes to reduce re-identification risks, were established. Data quality controls, variable masking, and data grouping strategies were implemented to successfully mitigate risks while preserving the dataset’s utility.
